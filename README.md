# Binary-Search-Tree
An implementation of the SimpleSSet(simple sorted set) interface using a binary search tree (BST) as the underlying data structure to store the elements.

Also, there is a program, VocabularyTester, that reads all of the words in a given (presumably large) text file, and reports the number of distinct words in the file.
